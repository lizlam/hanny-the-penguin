Hanny the Penguin was sitting outside.
A butterfly landed on her bill.
"Hello pretty butterfly!" said Hanny.

The butterfly fluttered her wings twice and then stood perfectly still.
"What is your name, pretty butterfly?"

The butterfly didn't answer.

Sally the seal came waddling up.

"Hello Hanny!" said Sally.
"Hello Sally! Do you speak butterfly?" Hanny asked.

Sally thought for a moment.

"I don't but I think we can find someone who can!" said Sally.
