Hanny the penguin was walking outside.
A butterfly landed on her bill.
"Hello pretty butterfly!" said Hanny.

The butterfly fluttered her wings twice and then stood perfectly still.

"What is your name, pretty butterfly?", asked Hanny.

The butterfly fluttered her wings twice again.

"Sorry pretty butterfly. I don't know what you are saying." said Hannah.

Hannah saw Sally the seal in the distance and hurried towards her.

"Hello Hanny!" said Sally.

"Hello Sally! Do you speak butterfly?" Hanny asked.

The butterfly fluttered her wings again.

Sally thought for a moment.

"I don't but I think we can find someone who can!" said Sally.
