Hanny the penguin was pacing around her room one day.  Thinking in her head, "Which came first, the penguin or the egg?"

She walked outside and saw a group of her friends playing.  

"Come and play with us, Hanny!" shouted her friends.

Hanny asked, "Which came first, the penguin or the egg?"

Her friends looked at each other and wasn't sure what to say.  
Millie, the oldest in the group replied, "Don't worry about such questions and just come and play!"

Hanny kept on walking and wondering, leaving her friends behind.

Hanny walked up to the edge of the water and looked out to the sea.
She saw her good friend Wally the Whale come up for a breath of fresh air. 

"Hello Hanny!" exclaimed Wally.
"Hello Wally" replied Hanny.

"Wally, do you know? Which came first, the penguin or the egg?" Hanny asked.

Wally stared at Hanny, not knowing how to answer.  

"I don't know Hanny.  Why do you ask?"

"Oh, I'm just wondering. I need to keep thinking.  See you later."

Hanny walked away as Wally waved goodbye with his tale.
