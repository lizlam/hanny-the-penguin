Hanny the penguin was pacing around her room one day.  Thinking in her head, "Which came first, the penguin or the egg?"

She walked outside and saw a group of her friends playing.  

"Come and play with us, Hanny!" shouted her friends.

Hanny looked up and asked, "Which came first, the penguin or the egg?"

Her friends looked at each other and wasn't sure what to say.  
Millie, the oldest in the group replied, "Don't worry about such questions and just come and play!"

Hanny kept on walking and wondering, letting her friends continue.
