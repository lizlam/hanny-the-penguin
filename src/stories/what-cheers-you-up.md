Hanny the penguin was stuck inside the house one afternoon.    

No one was outside since it was so windy and chilly.

Mother penguin said to Hanny,
"Why don't you write a letter to your pen pal, Lin?
 I'm sure it will cheer you up."

Hanny thought this was a good idea.

She grabbed a piece of paper and pencil, sat down and began to write.

> Dear Lin,
>    It is cold and windy here.  
>    No one is playing outside.  
>    Mother said writing you would cheer me up.  
>        
>       your pen pal,
>           Hanny



Lin was sitting in a tree when she heard her mother yell,"
Lin!! Lin!! You have a letter from Hanny!"

Lin was always excited to get letters from Hanny and quickly
climb down the tree.  She ran into the house and read the letter.

"What did Hanny say?" Mother panda asked.

"It is cold where she is and she is sad because she can not go outside to play."

> Dear Hanny,    
>     I know it is cold outside, but don't be sad.  Just think about the
>     things that cheers you up.  I know when I am sad, I think about 
>     eating yummy bamboo with my family.  I think about playing with my
>     brothers and sisters.  I think about taking a good nap.  Thinking about
>     these things cheers me up.  What cheers you up?

>          your pen pal,
