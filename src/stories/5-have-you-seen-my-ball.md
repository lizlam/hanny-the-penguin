Hanny the Penguin was playing ball with her friends. Someone kicked the ball to her and she hits it high into the hair.

The ball lands and rolls as it disappears beyond the playing area.

"I'll go get it," says Hannah as she runs after the ball.

Hanny comes across a fancy chicken party, full of chickens wearing fancy clothes. She stops to ask one of the fnacy chicken party goers,

"Have you seen my ball?"

Two fancy chicken in mid conversation stop and look at her. A chicken wearing fancy pearls reply,

"Oh hello darling! I'm sorry, we haven't seen your ball."

Disappointed, Hanny continues to search.

Hanny continues to walk and approaches a large dark cave. Determined to find her ball, she bravely walks in.

To her astonishment, the cave had a winged creature sleeping upside down! The creature slowly woke up from his slumber and stretched out his wings.

"Are you a bird?" Hanny asked.

"No, I'm a bat!" exclaimed the sleepy creature.

"I'm sorry to wake you up, Mr. Bat, but have you
seen my ball? It's so dark in here and I can barely see a thing!"

Mr. Bat stopped and listened very carefully and looked towards a corner of the cave where a ball was gently bouncing again the cave wall. He flew to the ball and scurried it towards Hanny.

"Oh thank you!" Hanny excitedly said.
"Would you like to play ball with my friends an dI?"

The bat yawned lazily, "It's much too early to play ball, but thank you for the invitation."

"Ok, Mr. Bat! Have a good nap." Hanny said as she
hurried back to her friends. She was so thankful to have found her ball.
